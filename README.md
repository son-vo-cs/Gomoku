The project uses Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for the AI (Artificial Intelligence).


Currently the project is only for 1 player.

Future works:
  + Add an option to choose player vs player
  + Make more levels (easy-medium-hard)
  + Add more GUI to let users choose who will go first, and let them choose the color of their stones
